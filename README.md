# Abstract
The aim of the project was to develop a model with binomial dependent variables explaining determinants of studentsâ€™ graduate rate. In order to decide which model is the most appropriate, three models were developed (probit, logit and linear probability). Using the general to specific approach all insignificant variables were removed. Afterwards all models were subjected to tests such as Linktest, Likelihood test and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Furthermore, R square statistics were calculated to understand each model and compare how well the dependent variable is explained in each of them. Based on the AIC, the logit model was selected. Within the key findings of the model three were identified: administrative studies had the largest dropout probability out of all the course categories, prior academic achievements of the student seem not to be a factor of high value when assessing the probability of the student to graduate and if the father drops out in 12th grade (last year in high school) then the student is less likely to drop in comparison to a student whose father left after completing any of grades in secondary or high school. The decision to dropout has many consequences. Identifying students who can potentially drop out at an early stage can help the educational institutions develop strategies, which would provide the necessary aid. Furthermore, the topic of education is also important as it is one of the factors that drive economic growth.
